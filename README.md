# Weather App Made With React

An elegant, simplistic weather app built using ReactJS. This project is deployed using GitHub pages and can be viewed [here.](https://alessandropotenza.github.io/weather-app/)

## Description
Search for a city of your choice and you will be provided with a description of their local conditions, their current high/low and temp, and a fitting background image that suits their conditions.

## Instructions
Enter the name of your city and press enter or click the search icon to process your request. If the name you have entered is shared by multiple cities, place a comma after the city name followed by the Alpha-2 code of the country yours is in.
Ex. 'Naples, US' will give Naples in Florida, USA instead of the Italian city.
