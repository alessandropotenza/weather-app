## Instructions
Enter the name of your city and either press enter or click the search icon to process your request. If the city you have entered is recognized, you will be provided with a description of their local conditions, their current high/low and temp, and a fitting background image that suits their conditions. If the city is not recognized, the screen will remain unchanged.

**Note:** If the name you have entered is shared by multiple cities, place a comma after the city name followed by the Alpha-2 Country Code of its country to get your desired location. For example, 'Naples, US' will provide data for Naples, USA, while 'Naples, IT' will provide data for Naples, Italy.
